# TCP Socket Programming in C
A client-server socket communication system enabling real-time data exchange between multiple devices.

This project's goal is to use socket programming in C to create a system that allows duplex communication between several nodes in a Local Area Network (LAN).  Through a dependable connection created with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), this system enables file transfers as well as communication between customers.

A common communication protocol called TCP outlines how to create and preserve a network connection so that programs can share information.  The Internet Protocol (IP), which manages packet addressing and routing between computers, collaborates with it.  Until all data has been successfully transferred, TCP, being a connection-oriented protocol, makes sure that a dependable channel is established between the client and server.

Sockets serve as the communication endpoints between client and server applications in this project.  The client starts the conversation while the server waits for new connections.  Once connected, the send() and recv() system methods can be used to send and receive


**How to Run the Project**

Ensure all nodes are connected to the same LAN network (wired or wireless).

Identify the IP addresses of each node using the command:

**ifconfig**


Update the IP addresses in the client.c file to match the nodes that need to communicate.

Compile both source files using a C compiler:

**gcc server.c -o server**
**gcc client.c -o client**


Run the compiled executables in separate terminals on different nodes:

**./server**
**./client**


When running the server, provide an acceptable port number for communication.

Use the clientâ€™s menu-driven interface to connect to other nodes, send messages, or transfer files.
